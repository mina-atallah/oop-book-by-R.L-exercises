# Object Oriented Programming in c++ (4th Edition) by Robert Lafore
This repository contains my solutions for the exercises found in the book. 

## Reason for creating this repository
As someone not from CS background i found learning programming by such a powerful language like c++ is good because it gives the student a lot of details of what is happening behind the scenes and teach them about memory management and many important concepts and details which are very important to build robust software systems. So this repository is my starting step in this journey for becoming a software engineer.
